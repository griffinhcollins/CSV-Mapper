This technique is being implemented at the Florey-Austin site for clinical treatment of essential tremor. Challenges for MRgFUS treatment planning include
(i) targeting thalamic subnuclei to maximise treatment response, and (ii) identification of proximal healthy brain circuits to avoid poor health outcomes
following the procedure. The aim of this project is to use advanced MRI-based methods for mapping structural and functional brain networks to identify
candidate thalamic sub-nuclei for thermal ablation using MRI-guided high intensity focused ultrasound. The feasibility of our proposed approach will be
assessed by evaluating the relationship between imaging-derived thalamic targets and post-procedure outcomes in individuals undergoing MRgFUS for treatment of essential tremor.

Trial 3961-8: Using manual mapping for summary from event for_participating_arm_1 with value The current study aims to utilise a prospective study design to investigate a series of novel clinical measures and tissue biomarkers through the prodromal Parkinson's Disease (pPD) and early Parkinson's disease (PD) periods. Each clinical measure will be monitored for change over a three year follow up period, and will be analyzed in isolation and in combination as a method for predicting disease timepoint and imminent conversion to clinical Parkinson's Disease.

Rem sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is a recognised prodromal marker of degenerative synucleinopathies, with the vast majority of cases resulting in PD (1). RBD participants will therefore be sourced as pPD participants. Early PD participants will include participants meeting the extant clinical diagnostic paradigm for PD, who have demonstrated a typical response to dopamine therapy in the clinical setting.

RBD participants, early PD participants and control participants will be followed prospectively, with six monthly assessments of (a) Real-time quake inversion recovery alpha synuclein analysis on serum, skin biopsy and nasopharyngeal swab (b) serial systemic inflammatory indeces (c) visual perception (d) fine and gross motor dexterity (e) autonomic function

Our team will undertake a mixed methods study throughout the duration of the service implementation to enable the service design to be optimised to meet the needs of young stroke survivors. The study will include semi-structured interviews and the collection of questionnaire data from young stroke survivors, family members and clinicians, to understand their evaluation and views on their access to health services following a stroke, including experiences of the Young Stroke Service.

The role of the Florey in this project relates to data linkage from the Young Stroke Service: Data linkage is being undertaken to evaluate and compare the different services within the YSS and the impact upon the individuals within the service. The data linkage will be undertaken using deidentified data extracted from the datasets being collected at the different hub sites within the YSS and through the main YSS administration at the Florey.

Trial 3970-2: Using manual mapping for summary from event for_participating_arm_1 with value This study aims to investigate saccadic eye movements in individuals with focal epilepsy, comparing to healthy controls. Saccadic eye movements are rapid shifts in gaze that play a crucial role in visual attention and cognitive processing. Because these movements are closely linked to brain function, examining them may provide valuable insights into how epilepsy and its treatments affect neurological processes. By identifying potential differences in eye movement control, this research could contribute to improved methods for assessing and managing epilepsy.
We hypothesize that individuals with focal epilepsy will exhibit prolonged saccadic reaction times, indicating a delay in their ability to initiate eye movements in response to visual stimuli. Additionally, we expect that they will show a reduced ability to inhibit reflexive saccades, meaning they may struggle to suppress automatic eye movements. We also predict that these effects will be more pronounced in individuals taking multiple antiseizure medications, suggesting a dose-dependent relationship. Furthermore, we anticipate that eye movements controlled by the hemisphere from which seizures originate will be slower and less accurate than those controlled by the unaffected hemisphere. Finally, given the established relationship between eye movements and cognitive function, we expect that measures of cognitive performance based on eye movements will correspond with results from standard neuropsychological assessments.
This research has significant implications for the study and treatment of focal epilepsy. By examining eye movement abnormalities, we may develop novel, non-invasive techniques for assessing cognitive and neurological function in individuals with epilepsy. These findings could enhance diagnostic accuracy, inform treatment decisions, and ultimately improve patient care.
